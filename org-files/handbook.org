* Introduction

** The World of Titan Mage

The world of Titan Mage began with the titans. The colossal beings used might and magic to shear the plains flat, heat the core of the planet, and gift the world with water and sun. Today, their fossilized remains are strewn about the world in hidden groves. Nobody knows how they came to die, but legend says that they gave up their power willingly, to share their earthen canvas with the rest of life's creatures.

Without the chaos of the titan's ongoing construction, the creatures of the world were allowed to grow and evolve. With enough time, the lands became overgrown with all manner of beast. Intelligence alone was not enough to live at the top of the food chain, so lowly humans were relegated to hiding and building what defenses they could, praying that their independent settlements not fall victim to ruin.

But the world is beginning to change once again. Humans are uncovering the magic that the titans left behind. With this newfound power, they are striking out, exploring the world, and trading with others for the first time. It is in this setting that Titan Mage takes place. There is high demand for those who can defend against the wilds. The best adventurers of the world are renowned and exalted, but not many of them are very wrinkled...

** What is Needed to Play

Titan Mage is meant to be played with two or more players. The sweet spot is 3 to 5 players and another player be the Game Master, abbreviated GM from here on out.

Each player requires one full set of RPG dice: a four sided die (d4), a six sided die (d6), a ten sided die (d10), a twelve sided die (d12), a twenty sided die (d20), and a ten sided die with multiples of 10 (used with the d10 to make a d100).

It is recommended to have two sets per player so that multi-dice rolls can occur at once.

Any die with a zero side is used as the max value for the die. For example, the zero on a d10 has a value of 10.

** Creating a Character

Use the following checklist to create a new character.

- Download a new [[./titan-mage-character-sheet.pdf][character sheet]] and optionally a [[./titan-mage-point-tracker.pdf][point tracking sheet]]
- Decide on a [[* Player Classes][player class]].
- Add one point to any two of the main stats [[* The Main Stats][main stats]].
- Decide on a [[* Systems of Magic][magic system]] compatible with your player class.
  - Fill in your starting spell choices.
- Give youself a short sword or staff weapon.
- Fill in your [[* Auxiliary Stats][aux stats]] based on your class and main stats
  - Use the defaults of five [[* Defense Threshold][defense threshold]], zero [[* Defense][defense]], zero [[* Magic Resistance][magic resistance]], and five [[* Movement Speed][movement speed]]. Max [[* Health Points (HP)][HP]] and max [[* Magic Power (MP)][MP]] start at 15, but may be higher based on the chosen [[* The Main Stats][main stats]].
- Formulate a [[* Motivation][motivation]].
- Fill in your character name.
- (optional) Fill in a character description.
  - The motivation is enough to start a game. A description can always be added to later.

** Conventions

This section lists some conventions used in Titan Mage.

- *Rounding*: Any time rounding is required, always round up.
- *Dice Markings*: Damage values are usually marked with die to roll, d6, d10, etc. If multiple dice of the same type are to be rolled, the dice value will be prefixed with a number. For example 4d6 means to roll 4 d6 dice and add the value of all the rolls together. Some dice rolls are marked with a tilde and parentheses ~(2d4). For these rolls, roll 2 dice and subtract the larger value from the smaller. This may use dice of different size, e.g. ~(d4,d6). Always subtract the larger rolled value, regardless of which die has more sides.

* Character Stats

** Character Level

The level of your character is a measure of how skilled they are at their craft. This skill is manifested in additional stats, features, and magical ability.

Character level starts at 1 and goes up to 16. In order to level up, characters need to both gain experience out adventuring and spend time and money in [[* Towns][town]]. It is up to you to choose when to spend the time and money to learn the next level during [[* Town Actions][your town actions]].

At the 6th level, a study under a master is required. Masters are not uncommon, but are not found in every town. At the 11th level, a study under a grandmaster is required. Although most grandmasters are well known in story and legend, not all of them can be easy to find. In order to attain the 16th level, one has to advance their field beyond it's current limits. Work with your DM to discuss your plan for this, as such things do not come with a one size fits all price tag.

Use the following requirements chart to see what it takes to make it to level up. While spending the time to level up, [[* Living Expenses][living expenses]] do not need to be paid, but if others in the party are not leveling up at the same time, they will need to pay them.

#+begin_xtable

#+end_xtable

Whenever you level up, perform the following actions:

- Add five to your [[* Health Points (HP)][HP]] and [[* Magic Power (MP)][MP]]
- Increase two different [[* The Main Stats][main stats]] by one point
- Recalculate [[* Auxiliary Stats][aux stats]] as needed

** The Main Stats

Main stats directly measure character prowess. They influence other stats and are used for determining outcomes in [[* Ability Check][ability checks]].

These stats range from 1 to 21. When stats are upgraded, the effects of stats are always retroactive.

Stats are often to modify the damage of attacks or spells as either + stat, + stat/2, or + stat/4. Use the following table to reference these values.

| Stat | Stat/2 | Stat/4 |
|------+--------+--------|
|    0 |      0 |      0 |
|    1 |      1 |      1 |
|    2 |      1 |      1 |
|    3 |      2 |      1 |
|    4 |      2 |      1 |
|    5 |      3 |      2 |
|    6 |      3 |      2 |
|    7 |      4 |      2 |
|    8 |      4 |      2 |
|    9 |      5 |      3 |
|   10 |      5 |      3 |
|   11 |      6 |      3 |
|   12 |      6 |      3 |
|   13 |      7 |      4 |
|   14 |      7 |      4 |
|   15 |      8 |      4 |
|   16 |      8 |      4 |
|   17 |      9 |      5 |
|   18 |      9 |      5 |
|   19 |      9 |      5 |
|   20 |      9 |      5 |
|   21 |     10 |      6 |

There are four main stats.

*** Power

/Power is used to express physical strength. Cleave, crush, and grapple your way through enemies./

Effects:

- Extra [[* Health Points (HP)][HP]]: Gain Power / 4 extra HP per level
- Traditional weapon effectivness: Extra damage with traditional weapons

*** Reflex

/Reflex measures your speed and reaction. Evade dangers and act before others. A high reflex shoots first./

Effects:

- Combat order: Higher reflex acts first
- Modified defense threshold: [[* Defense Threshold][Defense threshold]] reduced by Reflex / 4 when wearing light armor
- Special weapon effectviness: Extra damage with specialized weapons

*** Presence

/A high presence signifies awareness of the world around you. Anticipate the actions of others and make them pay for their predictability./

Direct Effects:

- Crit chance: [[* Damage Types][Physical damage]] critical strike chance: D20 roll <= Presence
- Enhanced Spells: Extra spell damage

*** Focus

/Focus allows you to concentrate and understand complex concepts. Outwit opponents through careful planning./

Effects:

- Extra MP: Gain Focus / 4 MP per level
- Extra [[* Systems of Magic][learned spells]]: Learn Focus / 4 additional spells

** Auxiliary Stats

*** Health Points (HP)

Health points tracks the life of your character. At 0 HP, your character becomes [[* Incapacitated][incapacitated]].

Character start with 15 HP and gain five extra HP at every level.

*** Magic Power (MP)

Magic power tracks the amount of magic that a character can perform. Characters gain extra magic power at every level based on their [[* Player Classes][class]].

Character start with 15 MP and gain five extra MP at every level.

*** Defense

Defense provides flat physical damage reduction. Defense is provided primarily by your [[* Combat Equipment][armor]]. Certain abilities are able to reduce an opponents defense and are marked as /armor piercing/.

*** Defense Threshold

The reduction in damage provided by [[* Defense][defense]] only goes into effect after a certain ammount of damage is taken. This amount is the damage threshold.

Damage threshold is set to five by default, but can be affected by [[* Combat Equipment][armor]], the [[* Reflex][reflex]] stat, by utilizing shields, and specific effects. Defense threshold can not be lowered below one. Thus, every physical attack with at least one point of damage will inflict at least one damage.

As an example, say you have 3 defense and 5 defense threshold. If you take 7 damage, you take the first 5 points of damage directly, leaving 2 damage that can be affected by defense. 3 defense is greater than 2 damage, so both points of damage are negated and your HP is reduced by 5.

*** Magic Resistance

Magic resistance provides flat magic damage reduction. Magic resistance is rare, and is not provided by any normal armors. There is no magic resistance threshold, the reduction is always applied.

*** Movement Speed

Movement speed is a measure how fast your character is. In [[* Combat][combat]], your character is allowed to move up to their movement speed in tiles every round.

A character's movement speed is set to 5 by default. It can be reduced by certain armors and items.

When moving diagonal, treat the first diagonal move as one tile of movement, the second diagonal move as two tiles of movement, then one, then two, etc.

* Combat

In combat, players and enemies take turns performing actions.

** Action Types

A turn is broken up into one powerful major action, one utility minor action, and as many as needed free actions.

Major actions are the powerful actions used primarily to deal damage. If desired, a minor action in place of a major action giving you two minor actions in a single turn.

Minor actions are mostly used to reposition or support using a major action.
One is always free to use a minor action in place of a major action.

Free actions are quick light actions such as shouting a command or turning a lock.


** Default Major Actions

*** Weapon Attack

Characters make an attack against an enemy using an equipped weapon. An unarmed attack can be made for 1 damage if no weapons are equipped.

Whenever a weapon attack that inflicts [[* Damage Types][physical damage]] is made, roll a d20. If your roll [[* Presence][presence]] stat is equal or higher than the roll, double the damage of the attack.

*** Spell Cast

Characters who are learned in a [[* Systems of Magic][school of magic]] can cast any spell that has been learned.

*** Guard

Characters have their [[* Defense Threshold][defense threshold]] set to one until the beginning of their next turn. In addition, if a [[* Combat Equipment][shield]] is equiped, gain the extra [[* Defense][defense]] provided by the shield's stats, as if the [[* Block][block]] minor action was used.

*** Defend

When standing over another player who is [[* Incapacitated][incapacitated]], the defend action prevent them from taking further damage from physical damage. Instead, damage is directed at you.

*** Second Minor Action

Use a second minor action in place of a major action.

** Default Minor Actions

*** Movement

Characters move up to their [[* Movement Speed][movement speed]].

*** Minor Spell Cast

Learned spells marked as minor actions can be cast during the minor action of a turn.

*** Offhand Weapon Attack

Characters with two one handed weapons can attack with the off hand as a minor action. Offhand weapon damage ignores any scaling from [[* Character Stats][stats]] and only deals damage from the dice rolls. In addition offhand attacks cannot crit.

*** Block

Characters with a [[* Combat Equipment][shield]] equipped can use this minor action to gain the [[* Defense][defense]] bonus and [[* Defense Threshold][defense threshold]] modifier of their shield.

*** Quaff

Drink a [[* Potions][potion]].

*** Reload

Characters load ammunition into a ranged weapon, a bow for example.

*** Swap Held Equipment

Characters put away, replace, or take out [[* Combat Equipment][held equipment]].

** Turn Order

Turn order is decided by the [[* Reflex][reflex]] stat. A higher stat means you go first. Ties are decided by the players.


** Damage Types

Damage dealt by weapons is counted as physical damage and can be reduced by the [[* Defense][defense]] stat (after [[* Defense Threshold][defense threshold]] is calculated in). When making a physical damage attack, make sure to roll a d20 to check for [[* Presence][crits]].

Damage dealt by spells is counted as magical damage and can be reduced by the [[* Magic Resistance][magic resistance]] stat. Attacks made with magical damage can not crit.

** Conditions

*** Blinded

A blinded character can only make attacks against the last enemy that took their turn. Creatures with other heightened senses may not be affected by blindness.

*** Chilled

When chilled, you may only take a [[* Default Major Actions][major action]] on your turn.

*** Grappled

Grappled targets are unable to take the [[* Movement][movement]] minor action.

*** Exhausted

Characters who are exhausted cannot take major actions and their [[* Movement Speed][movement speed]] is reduced by half.

*** Fallen

In the fallen condition, you are unable to make the [[* Weapon Attack][weapon attack]] major action or the [[* Movement][movement]] minor action. Standing back up takes a major action. While fallen, instead of the normal movement minor action, you can use a minor action to roll one tile.

*** Incapacitated

When a player drops below 0 [[* Health Points (HP)][HP]], they become incapacitated. They are unable to take major or minor actions or regain HP normally.

Upon entering the state, the character becomes afflicted by a [[* Grievous Wound][grievous wound]] and must roll to find out which.

The player reamins incapacitated until the end of the current fight, after which they will return to 0 HP and can be be healed normally with potion, [[* Respite][respite]], or other HP restoring effects.

The condition can also be ended in the middle of combat by a spell or item that provides the revive affect, returning the character to 1 HP and ending the incapacitated state.

Every time a character is attacked while incapacitated, they suffer another [[* Grievous Wound][grievous wound]]. Some foes may ignore downed combatants, but not all are so merciful.

*** Paralyzed

A paralyzed character is unable to take any action. Their [[* Defense Threshold][defense threshold]] is doubled while paralyzed.

*** Death

Death is the end of your playable character. They have succumbed to their injuries and pass on to the final rest.

This is a good chance to say some final words to your comrades.

** Grievous Wound

When a character sustains critical injury, they become afflicted by a grievous wound. Roll a d6 to determine your characters grievous wound. This wounds cannot be removed by normal healing. If any grievous wound, except for Lucky Save, is rolled two times, then the character suffers [[* Death][death]].

*(1) Lucky Save*

Your character sees life flash before their eyes, but fortune favors the lucky. No negative effects are experienced.

*(2) Head Trauma*

The character is unable to remember details about their past. They must invent a new [[* Motivation][motivation]].

*(3) Gnarly Scars*

The many wounds gained over time have accumulated and worn down the player. Their maximum [[* Health Points (HP)][HP]] is halved.

*(4) Damaged Arm*

Damage to one arm becomes too severe to save. Your character is no longer able to wield two handed equipment and can only wield one one handed equipment.

*(5) Damaged Leg*

Bone injuries have left the player with a worn gait. Their base [[* Movement Speed][movement speed]] is reduced by two.

*(6) Death*

The character experiences [[* Death][death]].

** Recovering

Recovering is the process of regaining HP and MP. Certain classes regain additional resources while recovering.

*** Respite

A respite is the only recovery that can occur while out adventuring. A respite requires an uninterrupted rest of at least 4 hours. Spending 8 or more hours resting does not increase the resources gained, and a respite can only occur once a day.

After a respite, each player rolls a d6 up to their character level number of times. The players choose whether to add the value on the die rolled to their [[* Health Points (HP)][HP]] or [[* Magic Power (MP)][MP]].

Once character level number of respite dice have been rolled, no more can be rolled until a full recovery has occurred.

Respite can be modified by certain [[* Player Classes][classes]] and [[* Systems of Magic][magic systems]].

*** Full Recovery

A full recovery restores all of a character's [[* Health Points (HP)][HP]] and [[* Magic Power (MP)][MP]], but can only occur in [[* Towns][town]] over the period of a week. A full recovery will reset the number of respite dice rolled back to zero.

* Roleplaying

** Skills

Skills are trades that can be learned while in [[* Towns][town]] in order to augment a character's abilities. Skills take three months of time to learn and have an upfront cost. A character can learn a maximum of three skills.

*** Alchemy

The alchemy skill allows you to identify potions on your own. In addition, you can craft a simple potion during a [[* Respite][respite]].

Alchemy requires 1,000 shells to learn.

*** Appraisal

Appraisal lets you to better determine the value of rare items like gems, idols, and the like.

Appraisal requires 500 shells to learn.

*** Horseback Riding

*** Smithing

The smithing skill helps you to determine the value of weapons that you come across. In addition, you can craft common weapons while in [[* Town Actions][town]].

Smithing requires 1,000 shells to learn.

** Ability Check

Ability checks are a way to use dice in combination with player stats to resolve an outcome.

The DM will ask for an ability check of a player for a particular [[* The Main Stats][main stat]]. It's the player's job to roll a d12 and add their stat to the roll. It will then be up to the DM to resolve outcome.

** Dialog

Speaking with Non-Player Characters (NPCs) is a common part of adventuring. Players may wish to elicit information from a knowledgeable town resident, haggle on the price of a rare artifact, or convince an animal that they are friendly.

When players are expecting a result out of their conversation, it's the job of the DM to recognize this and ask for an [[* Ability Check][ability check]]. Players have many ways to be convincing, and the strength of their argument can have a great affect on the difficulty of the ability check.

Dialog is also one of the best ways to show off your character's personality!

** Motivation

Your character's motivation describes why they have just become an adventurer. It can be as short as, "I vow to buy back my family's farm from the evil baron", or as long as you enjoy writing it.

An important point to keep in mind is that your character is just starting out. Every character is capable of great deeds, but you get to discover them through playing the game, not crafting a backstory. Discovering who your character is by playing is one of the pleasures of TTRPGs.

* Towns

Towns provide a safe haven between adventures, a place to rest weary bones, and prepare for what's next.

** Living Expenses

Every month of time spent in town incurs living expenses. The price of these expenses depends upon your desired station. It may be tempting to choose meager living expenses, but know that you station effects how others perceive you. The rarest [[* Artifacts][artifacts]] and most lucrative jobs often go to those of high station. The prices for living expenses are shown in the following table.

#+begin_xtable
| Station | Monthly Expenses |
|---------+------------------|
| Meager  | 10 Shells        |
| Frugal  | 25 Shells        |
| Average | 50 Shells        |
| High    | 100 Shells       |
| Royal   | 200 Shells       |
#+end_xtable

*** Adventure Hall

Adventure Halls are places where for hire adventurers can train and scout for work.

*** Apothecary

Apothecaries sell potions and droughts that may help you while you are away.

*** Bank

It's not very practical to carry around all the money and equipment that you have accumulated. Banks offer you a way to secure possessions.

*** Cartographer

Cartographers are designers of maps. The more expensive ones are typically the more accurate.

*** Cobbler

Cobblers sell and repair footwear.

*** General Store

General Stores sell simple craft and imported goods.

** Town Actions

You may be returning to town just for the sake of a [[* Full Recovery][full recovery]], but why not take advantage of what the town has to offer? Time spent in town is devoted to town actions. Town actions occur on the order of months, and each member of the party need not take the same town actions at the same time.

*** Learning Skills

Time in town can be spent learning a new [[* Skills][skill]]. See the list of skills for time and cost requirements.

*** Training

Time spent training at an [[* Adventure Hall][adventure hall]] allows you to [[* Character Level][level up]]. See the level up table for the time ranges and costs.

*** Mentorship

As your character gains levels, the ability to become a mentor assisting an unplayed character in leveling up becomes available. Players are responsible for creating a full character sheet for their mentee. A mentee must remain at least 5 levels lower than the player character.

Being a mentee takes time equal to the player character's . In exchange for your time and expertise, your character is rewarded with the price of [[* Character Level][level ups]] for the level the mentee gains.

Mentees are not able to gain levels back to back. Just like players, they need time to develop their new knowledge. This amount of time is at the DM's discretion.

Mentees may wish to join your adventuring party at such unfortunate times that room becomes available...

*** Philanthropy

Many organizations rely on the generosity of rich adventurers. You may wish to spend time donating funds or volunteering for an organization that your character is aligned with.

*** Research

Time can be spent researching a topic in town. Asking around, checking scholarly records. Some research tasks can go easier with a little grease.

Adventuring requires extreme preparation. Before embarking, it is wise to stock up on items to help you while away.

*** Spellwork

By practicing you magic craft, a spell from your spell list can be swapped out.

*** Working

Taking up temporary work allows you to live with frugal [[* Living Expenses][expenses]] without costing any gold. Performing skilled labor may pay for higher expenses and the DM's discretion.

** Bereft

The Bereft are those without any advantage in life. Unlikely adventurers, but it is not for fate to say who are the greats.

No magic systems. No class features. Mad respect.

* Systems of Magic

The power of the titans left its mark on the world. The study of these marks led to the beginning of the practice of magic. Independently, the studies led in different paths that lead to the groups of magic that are currently known.

Each group requires a lifetime of practice and a focus to the craft. Even then, some advanced magics are only able to be learned by those who give their complete energy to the study. These are known as advanced magics, while the easier magics are called the standard magics.

** Ancient Whisperer

The ancient whisperer magic system can only be learned by the [[* Scholar][scholar]] class.

The Ancient Whisperers have studied the lost spoken language of the titans. Through great mental exertion, they can recall incantations the forgotten language, shaping the world as the titans once did.

** Elementalist

Elementalists draw from the latent magic left behind from the construction of the world.

Elemental spells, called sourceries, can be devastatingly powerful, but rely on the setup and maintenance of elemental catalysts. Elementalists learn major and minor sourceries that can be used as major and minor actions.

Elementalists work with the catalysts of heat, cold, earth, lightning, and dark.  Sourceries that create these catalysts are marked with a type and amount, e.g. creates heat 2. Spells that consume the catalysts are marked with type and cost, e.g. consumes heat 1. At the end of the elementalist's turn, the value of each catalyst type is reduced by 1 to a minimum of 0.

** Runecast

The Runecast are warriors that pursue the study of an ancient written language. By etching these runic symbols into their weapons and armor, they are able to bind the power of magic to physical objects, and augment their combat ability.

Runes carved into your weapons and armor can be activated with a minor action. Whenever the effect of the rune is used [[* Magic Power (MP)][MP]] is lost. The passive effects of these runes are always present once activated. Runecast are only able to modify their own equipment and can not add runes to [[* Artifacts][artifacts]].
